This code computes circulation at each gridpoint about a radius of
arbitrary choosing, and then writes the field to the wind synthesis 
file as 'CIRC'.  The units are *10^4 m2/s.

Usage:  bin/computeC < input/computeC.input

If you already have a field by this name in your input netcdf file, the
field will be overwritten!

Edit input/computeC.input to change the input radar file name and directory 
(using the infile variable) and to change the radius about which the Eulerian 
circulation is computed (default is 1 km).
